# Citibike Member Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to break down some key components for both riders who are members as well as casual riders as well as finding out which stations might need more upkeep due to foot traffic. You can find the visualization I created posted to my public Tableau account found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/N2S4SSD54?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
